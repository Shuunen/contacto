This project is a Work In Progress !

Don't be so surprised, just show me project that is completely finished... no ? That's what I thought.

## Usage

```bash
npm install   # Project setup
npm run dev   # Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run build # Compiles and minifies for production
npm run test  # Run your tests
npm run lint  # Lints and fixes files
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
